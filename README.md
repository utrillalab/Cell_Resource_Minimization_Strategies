# Cell Resource Minimization Strategies

This repository contains the source code and data for the paper **"Engineering Resource Allocation in Artificially Minimized Cells: Is Genome Reduction the Best Strategy?"**. The goal of this project is to analyze genome and proteome reduction strategies in *E. coli* to optimize resource allocation.

## Overview

This project explores the computational modeling of resource savings from genome and proteome reduction strategies in *Escherichia coli* using a proteomics dataset and a genome-scale ME-model. The objective is to determine whether genome or proteome reduction is the best strategy for minimizing cellular resource consumption, particularly energy in terms of ATP.

## How to Use the Code

To use the code and run the simulations:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/utrillalab/Cell_Resource_Minimization_Strategies
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebooks in the following recommended order (see the next section for details).

## Notebooks Workflow

The following Jupyter notebooks contain the main analysis and simulations. They should be followed in this order to understand the process:

1. **Energy.ipynb**: This notebook introduces the initial energy cost calculations for replication, transcription, and translation of genes in the ME-model.
2. **Genome_vs_proteome.ipynb**: Compares resource savings from genome and proteome reduction strategies. Generates data that is saved in the `files/` directory.
3. **Replication_cost.ipynb, Transcription_cost.ipynb, UPF_cost.ipynb** (under `Energy_simulations/`): These notebooks detail the costs of specific cellular processes related to resource allocation.

## File Description

The `files/` directory contains output files generated from the notebooks. Here is a brief description of each subdirectory:

- `deleted_genes/`: Contains information about genes removed during genome reduction.
- `deleted_ranges/`: Defines the ranges of genome deletions used in different simulations.
- `ecolime_data/`: Contains codon usage data and other *E. coli* specific datasets.
- `proteome_Schmidt/`: Contains proteomic data from Schmidt et al., used in the analysis to calculate the proteome savings.
