## Overview

This project investigates the computational modeling of resource savings from genome and proteome reduction strategies in *Escherichia coli* using proteomics data and a genome-scale ME-model. The primary focus is to assess whether genome or proteome reduction is more efficient for minimizing cellular energy consumption (ATP usage).

## How to Use the Code

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utrillalab/Cell_Resource_Minimization_Strategies
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   If you're using Conda, you can create the environment from the `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate cell-resource-env
   ```
   Or, manually install dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks**:
   The recommended order for running the notebooks is detailed below.

## Notebooks Workflow

The Jupyter notebooks are the primary computational tools for this project. Follow the steps in the recommended order:

1. **[Energy_simulations/](src/Energy_simulations/)**:
   This directory contains additional simulations for the ATP costs of specific cellular processes:
   - `Replication_cost.ipynb`: Simulates ATP costs for DNA replication.
     - **Inputs**: 
       - `../../files/models/iJL1678b.pickle` (original model).
       - Percent DNA data: `[1, 1.125, 1.25, 1.5]`.
     - **Outputs**: Models saved as `../../files/models/DNA_per{value}.pickle` with modified DNA percentages.

   - `Transcription_cost.ipynb`: Simulates ATP costs for transcription processes.
     - **Inputs**: 
       - `../../files/models/iJL1678b.pickle` (original model).
       - `../../files/ecolime_data/codon_usage.csv` (codon usage data).
       - Genes added (Approximately a 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of the 4600 genes): `[230,460,690,920]`.
     - **Outputs**: Models saved as `../../files/models/AumGenes_GLC_OX_{number}.pickle` with added transcribed genes.

   - `UPF_cost.ipynb`: Simulates ATP costs for protein production (Universal Protein Fraction - UPF).
     - **Inputs**: 
       - `../../files/models/iJL1678b.pickle` (original model).
       - UPF new values:  `[0.24, .27, 0.30, .33, 0.36]`.
     - **Outputs**: Models saved as `../../files/models/ATPM_UPF_OX_GLC{UPF_value}.pickle` with different UPF settings.

2. **[Energy.ipynb](src/Energy.ipynb)**: 
   This notebook is the core analysis of ATP consumption, including per reaction, gene, and strain using the ME model. It also factors in ATP costs from replication, transcription, and protein production (results from `Energy_simulations/`).
